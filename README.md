# Search Reddit
This is a webapp that allows users to search for a word or phrase in a subreddit.  
[Here](https://reddit-searcher.streamlit.app/) is the streamlit powered app.  
## Use Cases
You might be an influencer or a fan of an influencer who wants to search several subreddits for that infulencers name.  
Maybe you want to search for Earthling Ed's name in r/Vegan to find what people there are saying about him.  
Or maybe you are doing research on thresher sharks and want to find each occurance of '**thresher shark**' in r/fish r/ocean and r/nature for inspiration  
### Contribution
I greatly appreciate **any and all** contributions.  Submit a pull request or leave a note in the issues!  Here is a list of issues that the app currently has:  
* There is no good way to stop a current query and start over again with different parameters
* the code is messy.  Any help cleaning it, especially the giant 'find_string_in_subreddit' function would be great
* The frontend is a bit buggy to use
* As now, there is no way to limit the number of submissions searched (e.g. checkbox to say "submissions per subreddit")

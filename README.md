# Search Reddit
This is a webapp that allows users to search for a word, phrase, or regex pattern in multiple subreddits.  
The hits are printed to the screen in the form of a link, making it super easy to find the submission.  
[Here](https://reddit-searcher.streamlit.app/) is the streamlit powered app.  
## Use Cases
Reddit's search does not permit the use of regex pattern searching nor does it allow you to limit your search to exact word matches.  
Reddit also does not allow you to limit a search to multiple subreddits.  
### Contribution
I greatly appreciate **any and all** contributions.  Submit a pull request or leave a note in the issues!  Here is a list of issues that the app currently has:  
* There is no good way to stop a current query and start over again with different parameters
* the code is messy.  Any help cleaning it, especially the giant 'find_string_in_subreddit' function would be great
